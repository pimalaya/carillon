## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Ctrl+C is prompt on every path
A requested shutdown SHALL be honoured within roughly a second on every path a watch can be waiting in: idling on a connection, sleeping between polls, backing off before a reconnect, or resolving an arrival's envelope. No path SHALL wait on a server that has stopped answering: every connection the daemon opens SHALL carry a read deadline and SHALL hand back the not-ready failures rather than letting the transport retry them away, since the deadline exists to be the wakeup that re-reads the flag.

#### Scenario: Ctrl+C while resolving against a silent server
- **GIVEN** a watch resolving an arrival's envelope against a server that has stopped answering
- **WHEN** the user presses Ctrl+C
- **THEN** the read deadline expires, the flag is seen, and the watch ends rather than waiting for the transport's own timeout
